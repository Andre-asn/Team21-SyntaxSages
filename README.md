# How do I go about working on my user story?
--> Create a new branch titled "mm-(user story # from Jira)" and clone the branch locally.
--> Once complete, publish the branch and create a pull request. We can go over the code and if we feel it is ready to be published, we can merge it into the main.
# How do I run the application so I can see how it looks while im developing?
--> Install the Expo Go app on your iPhone or Android device
--> When you clone the repo, run "npm install" in your terminal.
--> Afterwards, run "npx expo start --tunnel" (it may ask you to install some dependencies, you can go ahead and do that), then scan the QR Code with your mobile device and you should be able to see the app.
NOTE: If you want to close/restart the server for any reason, type Ctrl^C to stop the server, then you can run your expo start command again when ready

If you run into any trouble, let us know :)
